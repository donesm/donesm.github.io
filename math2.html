<blockquote>
<p>My philosophy on education is that education is about the desire to learn, not the obligation to. Learning should be fun, interesting, engaging, and helpful. Students should understand how to enjoy learning and gaining knowledge. Education is a life-long learning process. Students should be able to utilize their ability to create and solve problems both inside and outside the classroom environment. Education is everywhere and a part of everyday life. Education connects to real-life experiences and to be education is to be a modern citizen to help the needs of society. Students should be able to think critically and solve problems independent.&nbsp;</p>
